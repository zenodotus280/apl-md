### Problem
>There is a fundamental conflict in the nature of materials for building in industrial society.

### Solution
>Use only biodegradable, low-energy-consuming materials, which are easy to cut and modify on site. For bulk materials we suggest ultra-lightweight 40–60 lbs. concrete and earth-based materials like tamped earth, brick, and tile. For secondary materials, use wood planks, gypsum, plywood, cloth, chickenwire, paper, cardboard, particle board, corrugated iron, lime plasters, bamboo, rope, and tile.

### Related Patterns
... the principles of structure allow you to imagine a building in which materials are distributed in the most efficient way, congruent with the social spaces given by the plan - [[Structure Follows Social Spaces (205)]], [[Efficient Structure (206)]]. But of course the structural conception is still only schematic. It can only become firm and cogent in your mind when you know what materials the building will be made of. This pattern helps you settle on materials.

In [[Gradual Stiffening (208)]], We shall Work out the way of using these materials that goes with [[Structure Follows Social Spaces (205)]] and [[Efficient Structure (206)]]. Try to use the materials in such a way as to allow their own texture to show themselves - [[Lapped Outside Walls (234)]], [[Soft Inside Walls (235)]] ...
