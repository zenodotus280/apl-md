### Problem
>A house feels isolated from the nature around it, unless its floors are interleaved directly with the earth that is around the house.

### Solution
>Connect the building to the earth around it by building a series of paths and terraces and steps around the edge. Place them deliberately to make the boundary ambiguous—so that it is impossible to say exactly where the building stops and earth begins.

... this pattern helps to create the [[Building Edge (160)]] and its [[Arcades (119)]], [[Private Terrace on the Street (140)]], the [[Gallery Surround (166)]], and [[Six-Foot Balcony (167)]], by specifying the way the floor of the building reaches out into the land and gardens round about it.

Use the connection to the earth to form the ground for outdoor rooms, and entrances, and terraces - [[Entrance Room (130)]], [[Private Terrace on the Street (140)]], [[Outdoor Room (163)]], [[Terraced Slope (169)]]; prepare to tie the terraces continuously into the wall which forms the edge of the ground floor slab, to make the very structure of the building feel connected to the earth - [[Ground Floor Slab (215)]]; and where you come to form the terrace surfaces, use things like hand-made bricks and softbaked crumbling biscuit-fired tile - [[Soft Tile and Brick (248)]]; and further out, along the paths a little distance from the house, leave cracks between the tiles to let the grass and flowers grow between them - [[Paving With Cracks Between the Stones (247)]] ...
