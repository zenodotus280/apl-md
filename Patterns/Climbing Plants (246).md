### Problem
>A building finally becomes a part of its surroundings when the plants grow over parts of it as freely as they grow along the ground.

### Solution
>On sunny walls, train climbing plants to grow up round the openings in the wallâ€”the windows, doors, porches, arcades, and trellises.

### Related Patterns
... two earlier patterns can be helped by climbing plants around the building: [[Trellised Walk (174)]] and [[Filtered Light (238)]].
