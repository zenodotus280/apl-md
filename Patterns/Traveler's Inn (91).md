### Problem
>Somewhere in the community at least one big place where a few hundred people can gather, with beer and wine, music, and perhaps a half-dozen activities, so that people are continually cross-crossing from one to another.

### Solution
>Make the traveler’s inn a place where travelers can take rooms for the night, but where—unlike most hotels and motels—the inn draws all its energy from the community of travelers that are there any given evening. The scale is small—30 or 40 guests to an inn; meals are offers communally; there is even a large space ringed round with beds in alcoves.

This pattern shows how the hotels which cater to these visitors can most effectively help to sustain the life of these centers. 

The heart of the conviviality is the central area, where everyone can meet and talk and dance and drink - [[Common Areas at the Heart (129)]], [[Dancing in the Street (63)]], and [[Beer Hall (90)]]. Provide the opportunity for communal eating, not a restaurant, but common food around a common table - [[Communal Eating (147)]]; and, over and above the individual rooms there are at least some areas where people can lie down and sleep in public unafraid - [[Sleeping in Public (94)]], [[Communal Sleeping (186)]]. For the overall shape of the inn, its gardens, parking, and surroundings, begin with [[Building Complex (95)]] ...
