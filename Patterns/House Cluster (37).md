### Problem
>People will not feel comfortable in their houses unless a group of houses forms a cluster, with the public land between them jointly owned by all the householders.

### Solution
>Arrange houses to form very rough, but identifiable clusters of 8 to 12 households around some common land and paths. Arrange the clusters so that anyone can walk through them, without feeling like a trespasser.

### Related Patterns
... the fundamental unit of organization within the neighborhood - [[Identifiable Neighborhood (14)]] - is the cluster of a dozen houses. By varying the density and composition of different clusters, this pattern may also help to generate the [[Density Rings (29)]], [[Household Mix (35)]], and [[Degrees of Publicness (36)]].

Use this pattern as it is for low densities, up to about 15 houses per acre; at higher densities, modify the cluster with the additional structure given by [[Row Houses (38)]] or [[Housing Hill (39)]]. Always provide common land between the houses - [[Common Land (67)]] and a shared common workshop [[Home Workshop (157)]]. Arrange paths clearly - [[Circulation Realms (98)]] - and lay these paths out in such a way that they create busier paths and backwaters, even within the cluster - [[Degrees of Publicness (36)]]; keep parking in [[Small Parking Lots (103)]],and make the houses in the cluster suit the households which will live there - [[The Family (75)]], [[House for a Small Family (76)]], [[House for a Couple (77)]], [[House for One Person (78)]], [[Your Own Home (79)]].
