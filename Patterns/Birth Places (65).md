### Problem
>It seems unlikely that any process which treats childbirth as a sickness could possibly be a healthy part of a healthy society.

... both birth and death need recognition throughout society where people are, as part of local communities and neighborhoods - [[Community of 7000 (12)]], [[Identifiable Neighborhood (14)]], [[Life Cycle (26)]]. As far as birth is concerned, each group of neighborhoods must be able to take care of the birth process, in local, human terms. (Note: The development of this pattern is due largely to the work of Judith Shaw, at this writing a graduate student in architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, and a mother of three children.)

Include rooms where after the birth the mother and her baby can stay together with the other members of the family - sleep together, eat together, cook together - [[Common Areas at the Heart (129)]], [[Couple's Realm (136)]], [[Farmhouse Kitchen (139)]] ; provide a partly private garden to walk in - [[Half-Hidden Garden (111)]], [[Garden Wall (173)]]; for the shape of the building, gardens, parking, and surroundings, begin with [[Building Complex (95)]] ...
