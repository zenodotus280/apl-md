### Problem
>People need green open places to go to; when they are close they use them. But if the greens are more than three minutes away, the distance overwhelms the need.

### Solution
>Build one open public green within three minutes’ walk—about 750 feet—of every house and workplace. This means that the greens need to be uniformly scattered at 1,500-foot intervals, through the city. Make the greens at least 150 feet across, and at least 60,000 square feet in area.

### Related Patterns
... at the heart of neighborhoods, and near all work cominunities, there need to be small greens - [[Identifiable Neighborhood (14)]], [[Work Community (41)]] Of course it makes the most sense to locate these greens in such a way that they help form the boundaries and neighborhoods and backs - [[Subculture Boundary (13)]], [[Neighborhood Boundary (15)]], [[Quiet Backs (59)]]. 

Pay special attention to old trees, look after them - [[Tree Places (171)]]; shape the green so that it forms one or more positive room-like spaces and surround it with trees, or walls, or buildings, but not roads or cars - [[Positive Outdoor Space (106)]], [[Garden Wall (173)]]; and perhaps set aside some part of the green for special community functions - [[Holy Ground (66)]], [[Grave Sites (70)]], [[Local Sports (72)]], [[Animals (74)]], [[Sleeping in Public (94)]] ...
