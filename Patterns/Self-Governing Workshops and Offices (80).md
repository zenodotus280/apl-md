### Problem
>No one enjoys their work if they are a cog in a machine.

### Solution
>Encourage the formation of self-governing workshops and offices of 5 to 20 workers. Make each group autonomousâ€”with respect to organization, style, relation to other groups, hiring and firing, work schedule. Where the work is complicated and requires larger organizations, several of these work groups can federate and cooperate to produce complex artifacts and services.

... all kinds of work, office work and industrial work and agricultural work, are radically decentralized by [[Scattered Work (9)]], and [[Industrial Ribbon (42)]] and grouped in small communities - [[Work Community (41)]]. This pattern helps to generate these larger patterns by giving the fundamental nature of all work organizations, no matter what their type. 

House the workgroup in a building of its own - [[Office Connections (82)]], [[Building Complex (95)]]; if the workgroup is large enough, and if it serves the public, break it down into autonomous departments, easily identifiable, with no more than a dozen people each - [[Small Services Without Red Tape (81)]] in any case, divide all work into small team work, either directly within the cooperative workgroup or under the departments, with the people of each team in common space - [[Master and Apprentices (83)]] and [[Small Work Groups (148)]] ...
