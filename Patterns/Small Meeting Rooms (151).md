... within organizations and workplaces - [[University as a Marketplace (43)]], [[Local Town Hall (44)]], [[Master and Apprentices (83)]], [[Flexible Office Space (146)]], [[Small Work Groups (148)]], there will, inevitably, be meeting rooms, group rooms, classrooms, of one kind or another. Investigation of meeting rooms shows that the best distribution - both by size and by position - is rather unexpected.

People will feel best if many of the chairs are different, to suit different temperaments and moods and shapes and sizes - [[Different Chairs (251)]]. A light over the table or over the center of the group will help tie people together - [[Pools of Light (252)]]. For the shape of the room in detail, start with [[The Shape of Indoor Space (191)]] ...
