### Problem
>Where fast-moving cars and pedestrians meet in cities, the cars overwhelm the pedestrians. The car is king, and people are made to feel small.

### Solution
>We conclude that any pedestrian path along a road carrying fast-moving cars should be about 18 inches above the road, with a low wall or railing, or balustrade along the edge, to mark the edge. Put the raised walk on only one side of the roadâ€”make it as wide as possible.

### Related Patterns
... this pattern helps complete the [[Network of Paths and Cars (52)]] and [[Road Crossing (54)]]. It is true that in most cases, pedestrian paths which follow the path network will be running across roads, not next to them. But still, from time to time, especially along major [[Parallel Roads (23)]], between one road crossing and the next, there is a need for paths along the road. This pattern gives these special paths their character.

Protect the raised walk from the road, by means of a low wall -- [[Sitting Wall (243)]]. An arcade built over the wall, will, with its columns, give an even greater sense of comfort and at special points where a car might pull in t pick up or drop off passengers, build steps into the raised walk, large enough so people can sit here and wait in comfort -- [[Stair Seats (125)]].
