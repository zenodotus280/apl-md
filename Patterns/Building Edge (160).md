### Problem
>A building is most often thought of as something which turns inwardâ€”toward its rooms. People do not often think of a building as something which must also be oriented toward the outside.

### Solution
>Make sure that you treat the edge of the building as a "thing", a "place", a zone with volume to it, not a line or interface which has no thickness. Crenelate the edge of buildings with places that invite people to stop. Make places that have depth and a covering, places to sit, lean, and walk, especially at those points along the perimeter which look onto interesting outdoor life.

... assume that the position of the building edge is fixed - most recently by [[Light on Two Sides of Every Room (159)]] - and before that by the position of the building wings and their interior spaces and by the courts and gardens and streets between the buildings - [[Wings of Light (107)]], [[Positive Outdoor Space (106)]]. This pattern now sets the stage for the development of the zone between the indoors and the outdoors. Often this "zone" is thought of as an edge, a line on paper without thickness, a wall. But this is altogether wrong ...

Do it with arcades, galleries, porches, and terraces [[Arcades (119)]], [[Outdoor Room (163)]] , [[Gallery Surround (166)]], [[Six-Foot Balcony (167)]], [[Connection to the Earth (168)]]; take special account of the sun - [[Sunny Place (161)]], [[North Face (162)]]; and put in seats and windows which complete the feeling of connection - [[Stair Seats (125)]], [[Street Windows (164)]], [[Seat Spots (241)]], [[Front Door Bench (242)]] ...
