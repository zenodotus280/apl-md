### Problem
>Concentrated, cloistered universities, with closed admission policies and rigid procedures which dictate who may teach a course, kill opportunities for learning.

### Solution
>Establish the university as a marketplace of higher education. As a social conception this means that the university is open to people of all ages, on a full-time, part-time, or course-by-course basis. Anyone can offer a class. Anyone can take a class. Physically, the university marketplace has a central crossroads where its main buildings and offices are, and the meeting rooms and labs ripple out from this crossroadsâ€”at first concentrated in small buildings along pedestrian streets and then gradually becoming more dispersed and mixed with the town.

... the [[Network of Learning (18)]] has established the importance of a while society devoted to the learning process with decentralized opportunities for learning. The network of learning can be greatly helped by building a university, which treats the learning process as a normal part of adult life, for all the people in society.

Give the university a [[Promenade (31)]] as its central crossroads; and around the crossroads cluster the buildings along streets -- [[Building Complex (95)]]; [[Pedestrian Street (100)]]. Give this central area access to quiet green -- [[Quiet Backs (59)]]; and a normal distribution of housing -- [[Housing In Between (48)]]; as for the classes, wherever possible let them follow the model of [[Master and Apprentices (83)]] ...
