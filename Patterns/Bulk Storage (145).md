### Problem
>In houses and workplaces there is always some need for bulk storage space; a place for things like suitcases, old furniture, old files, boxes—all those things which you are not ready to throw away, and yet not using every day.

Place this storage somewhere in the building where it costs less than other rooms—because, of course, it doesn’t need a finish.

No matter whether it is an attic, cellar, or shed, it is usually good advice to follow [[North Face (162)]] and situate bulk storage to the north of the building, leaving the sunny, spaces for rooms and gardens ...
