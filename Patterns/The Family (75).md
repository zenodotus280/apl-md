### Problem
>The nuclear family is not by itself a viable social form.

### Solution
>Set up processes which encourage groups of 8 to 12 people to come together and establish communal households. Morphologically, the important things are:

>1. Private realms for the groups and individuals that make up the extended family: couple realms, private rooms, sub-households for small families.
>2. Common space for shared functions: cooking, working, gardening, child care.
>3. At the important crossroads of the site, a place where the entire group can meet and sit together.

If you place it properly, this house can help to form a cluster, or a row of houses, or a hill of houses - [[House Cluster (37)]], [[Row Houses (38)]], [[Housing Hill (39)]] - or it can help to keep a working community alive - [[Housing In Between (48)]]. This next pattern now gives you some vital information about the social character of the household itself. If you succeed in following this pattern, it will help repair [[Life Cycle (26)]] and [[Household Mix (35)]] in your community. 

Each individual household within the larger family must, at all costs, have a clearly defined territory of its own, which it controls - [[Your Own Home (79)]]; treat the individual territories according to the nature of the individual households - [[House for a Small Family (76)]], [[House for a Couple (77)]], [[House for One Person (78)]]; and build common space between them, where the members of the different smaller households can meet and eat together - [[Common Areas at the Heart (129)]], [[Communal Eating (147)]]. For the shape of the building, gardens, parking, and surroundings, begin with [[Building Complex (95)]] ...
