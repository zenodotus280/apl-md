### Problem
>More than 90 percent of the people walking about in an ordinary neighborhood are unhealthy, judged by simple biological criteria. This ill health cannot be cured by hospitals or medicine.

### Solution
>Gradually develop a network of small health centers, perhaps one per community of 7,000, across the city; each equipped to treat everyday disease—both mental and physical, in children and adults—but organized essentially around a functional emphasis on those recreational activities which keep people in good health, like swimming and dancing.
