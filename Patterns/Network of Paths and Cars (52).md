### Problem
>Cars are dangerous to pedestrians; yet activities occur just where cars and pedestrians meet.

### Solution
>Except where traffic densities are very high or very low, lay out pedestrian paths at right angles to roads, not along them, so that the paths gradually begin to form a second network, distinct from the road system, and orthogonal to it. This can be done quite gradually—even if you put in one path at a time, but always put them in the middle of the "block", so that they run across the roads.

### Related Patterns
... roads may be governed by [[Parallel Roads (23)]], [[Looped Local Roads (49)]], [[Green Streets (51)]]; major paths by [[Activity Nodes (30)]], [[Promenade (31)]], and [[Paths and Goals (120)]]. This pattern governs the interaction between the two.

Where paths have to run along major roads -- as they do occasionally -- build them 18 inches higher than the road, on one side of the road only, and twice the usual width -- [[Raised Walk (55)]]; on [[Green Streets (51)]] the paths can be in the road since there is nothing but grass and paving stones there; but even then, occasional narrow paths at right angles to the green streets are very beautiful. Place the paths in detail according to [[Path Shape (121)]]. Finally, treat the important street crossings and crosswalks, raised to the level of the pedestrian path -- so cars have to slow as they go over them -- [[Road Crossing (54)]].
