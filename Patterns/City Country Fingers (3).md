Whenever land is hilly, keep the country fingers in the valleys and the city fingers on the upper slopes of the hillsides -- [[Agricultural Valleys (4)]]. Break the city fingers into hundreds of distinct self-governing subcultures -- [[Mosaic of Subcultures (8)]], and run the major roads and railways down the middle of these fingers -- [[Web of Public Transport (16)]], [[Ring Roads (17)]] ...
