### Problem
>Gardens and small public parks don’t give enough relief from noise unless they are well-protected.

### Solution
>Form some kind of enclosure to protect the interior of a quiet garden from the sights and sounds of passing traffic. If it is a large garden or a park, the enclosure can be soft, can include bushes, trees, slopes, and so on. The smaller the garden, however, the harder and more defined the enclosure must become. In a very small garden, form the enclosure with buildings or walls; even hedges and fences will not be enough to keep out sound.

... in private houses, both the [[Half-Hidden Garden (111)]] and the [[Private Terrace on the Street (140)]] require walls. More generally, not only private gardens, but public gardens too, and even small parks and greens - [[Quiet Backs (59)]], [[Accessible Green (60)]], need some kind of enclosure round them, to make them as beautiful and quiet as possible.

Use the garden wall to help form positive outdoor space - [[Positive Outdoor Space (106)]]; but pierce it with balustrades and windows to make connections between garden and street, or garden and garden - [[Private Terrace on the Street (140)]], [[Trellised Walk (174)]], [[Half-Open Wall (193)]], and above all, give it openings to make views into other larger and more distant spaces - [[Hierarchy of Open Space (114)]], [[Zen View (134)]] ...
