### Problem
>The sight of action is an incentive for action. When people can see into spaces from the street their world is enlarged and made richer, there is more understanding; and there is possibility for communication, learning.

### Solution
>In any public space which depends for its success on its exposure to the street, open it up, with a fully opening wall which can be thrown wide open, and if it is possible, include some part of the activity on the far side of the pedestrian path, so that it actually straddles the path, and people walk through it as they walk along the path.
>There are dozens of ways to build such an opening. For example, a wall can be made very cheaply with a simply plywood hanging shutter sliding on an overhead rail, which can be removed to open up completely, and locked in place at night.

... many places in a town depend for their success on complete exposure to the people passing by - far more exposure than a [[Street Windows (164)]] can provide. [[University as a Marketplace (43)]], [[Local Town Hall (44)]], [[Necklace of Community Projects (45)]], [[Market of Many Shops (46)]], [[Health Center (47)]], [[Street Cafe (88)]], [[Building Thoroughfare (101)]] are all examples. This pattern defines the form of the exposure.

Give the opening a boundary, when it is entirely open, with a low solid wall which people can sit on - [[Sitting Wall (243)]] ; and make an outdoor room out of the part of the path which runs past it - [[Path Shape (121)]], [[Outdoor Room (163)]] ...
