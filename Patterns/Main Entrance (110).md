You also have an idea of the major circulation in the building complex and the lines of approach which lead toward the building - [[Circulation Realms (98)]], [[Family of Entrances (102)]]. Now it is time to fix the entrance of the building.

 If possible, make the entrance one of a family of similar entrances, so that they all stand out as visibly as possible within the street or building complex - [[Family of Entrances (102)]]; build that part of the entrance which sticks out, as a room, large enough to be a pleasant, light, and beautiful place - [[Entrance Room (130)]] and bring the path between the street and this entrance room through a series of transitions of light and level and view - [[Entrance Transition (112)]]. Make sure that the entrance has the proper relationship to parking - [[Shielded Parking (97)]], [[Car Connection (113)]] ...
