### Problem
>No social group—whether a family, a work group, or a school group—can survive without constant informal contact among its members.

### Solution
>Create a single common area for every social group. Locate it at the center of gravity of all the spaces the group occupied, and in such a way that the paths which go in and out of the building lie tangent to it.

### Related Patterns
... along the [[Intimacy Gradient (127)]], in every building and in every social group within the building, it is necessary to place the common areas. Place them on the sunlit side to reinforce the pattern of [[Indoor Sunlight (128)]]; and, when they are large, give them the higher roofs of the [[Cascade of Roofs (116)]].

Most basic of all to common areas are food and fire. Include [[Farmhouse Kitchen (139)]], [[Communal Eating (147)]], and [[The Fire (181)]]. For the shape of the common area in fine detail, see [[Light on Two Sides of Every Room (159)]] and [[The Shape of Indoor Space (191)]]. Make sure that there are plenty of different sitting places, different in character for different kinds of moments - [[Sequence of Sitting Spaces (142)]]. Include an [[Outdoor Room (163)]]. And make the paths properly tangent to the common areas - [[Arcades (119)]], [[The Flow Through Rooms (131)]], [[Short Passages (132)]] ...
