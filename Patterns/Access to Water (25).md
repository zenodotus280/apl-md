### Problem
>Whether the sacred sites are large or small, whether they are at the center of the towns, in neighborhoods, or in the deepest countryside, establish ordinances which will protect them absolutely—so that our roots in the visible surroundings cannot be violated.

### Solution
>When natural bodies of water occur near human settlements, treat them with great respect. Always preserve a belt of common land, immediately beside the water. And allow dense settlements to come right down to the water only at infrequent intervals along the water’s edge.

... Water is always precious. Among the special natural places covered by [[Sacred Sites (24)]], we single out the ocean beaches, lakes, and river banks, because they are irreplaceable. Their maintenance and proper use require a special pattern.

The width of the common land will vary with the types of water and the ecological conditions. In one case, it may be no more than a simple stone promenade along a river bank a few feet wide [[Promenade (31)]]. In another case, it may be a swath of dunes extending hundreds of yards beyond a beach -- [[The Countryside (7)]]. In any case, do not build roads along the water within one mile of the water; instead make all the approach roads at right angles to the edge, and very far apart -- [[Parallel Roads (23)]]. If parking is provided, keep the lots small -- [[Small Parking Lots (103)]] ...
