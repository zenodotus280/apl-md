### Problem
>Totalitarian, machine buildings do not require trim because they are precise enough to do without. But they buy their precision at a dreadful price: by killing the possibility of freedom in the building plan.

### Solution
>Wherever two materials meet, place a piece of trim over the edge of the connection. Choose the pieces of trim so that the smallest piece, in each component, is always of the order of 1/2 inch wide. The trim can be wood, plaster, terracotta…

... and this pattern finishes the joints between [[Soft Inside Walls (235)]], or [[Lapped Outside Walls (234)]] and the various floors and vaults and frames and stiffeners and ornaments which are set into the walls: [[Box Columns (216)]], [[Perimeter Beams (217)]], [[Floor-Ceiling Vaults (219)]], [[Frames as Thickened Edges (225)]], and [[Ornament (249)]].

In many cases, you may be able to use the trim to form the ornaments - [[Ornament (249)]]; and trims may occasionally be colored: even tiny amounts can help to make the light in a room warm - [[Warm Colors (250)]].
