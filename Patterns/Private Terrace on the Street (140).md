### Problem
>The relationship of a house to a street is often confused: either the house opens entirely to the street and there is no privacy; or the house turns its back on the street, and communion with street life is lost.

### Solution
>Let the common rooms open onto a wide terrace of a porch which looks into the street. Raise the terrace slightly above street level and protect it with a low wall, which you can see over if you sit near it, but which prevents people on the street from looking into the common rooms.

... among the common areas and sitting spaces - [[Common Areas at the Heart (129)]], [[Sequence of Sitting Spaces (142)]] - there is a need for one, at least, which puts the people in the house in touch with the world of the street outside the house. This pattern helps to create the [[Half-Hidden Garden (111)]] and gives life to the street - [[Green Streets (51)]] or [[Pedestrian Street (100)]].

If possible, place the terrace in a position which is also congruent with natural contours - [[Terraced Slope (169)]]. The wall, if low enough, can be a [[Sitting Wall (243)]]; in other cases, where you want more privacy, you can build a full garden wall, with openings in it, almost like windows, which make the connection with the street - [[Garden Wall (173)]], [[Half-Open Wall (193)]]. In any case, surround the terrace with enough things to give it at least the partial feeling of a room - [[Outdoor Room (163)]] ...
