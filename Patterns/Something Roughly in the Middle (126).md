### Problem
>A public space without a middle is quite likely to stay empty.

### Solution
>Between the natural paths which cross a public square or courtyard or a piece of common land, choose something to stand roughly in the middle: a fountain, a tree, a statue, a clock-tower with seats, a windmill, a bandstand. Make it something which gives a strong and steady pulse to the square, drawing people in toward the center. Leave it exactly where it falls between the paths; resist the impulse to put it exactly in the middle.

... [[Small Public Squares (61)]], [[Common Land (67)]], [[Courtyards Which Live (115)]], [[Path Shape (121)]] all draw their life from the activities around their edges - [[Activity Pockets (124)]] and [[Stair Seats (125)]]. But even then, the middle is still empty, and it needs embellishment.

Connect the different "somethings" to one another with the path system - [[Paths and Goals (120)]]. They may include [[High Places (62)]], [[Dancing in the Street (63)]], [[Pools and Streams (64)]], [[Public Outdoor Room (69)]], [[Still Water (71)]], [[Tree Places (171)]]; make sure that each one has a [[Sitting Wall (243)]] around it ...
