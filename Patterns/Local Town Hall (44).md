### Problem
>Local government of communities and local control by the inhabitants, will only happen if each community has its own physical town hall which forms the nucleus of its political activity.

### Solution
>To make the political control of local functions real, establish a small town hall for each community of 7,000, and even for each neighborhood; locate it near the busiest intersection in the community. Give the building three parts: an arena for public discussion, public services around the arena, and space to rent out to ad hoc community projects.

... according to [[Community of 7000 (12)]], the political and economic life of the city breaks down into small, self-governing communities. In this case, the process of local government needs a physical place of work; and the design and placing of this physical space of work can help to create and to sustain the [[Community of 7000 (12)]] by acting as its physical and social focus.

Arrange the arena so that it forms the heart of the community crossroads; and make it small, so that a crowd can easily gather there -- [[Activity Nodes (30)]], [[Small Public Squares (61)]], [[Pedestrian Density (123)]]. Keep all the public services around this square as small as possible -- [[Small Services Without Red Tape (81)]]; and provide ample space for the community projects, in a ring around the building, so that they form the outer face of the town hall -- [[Necklace of Community Projects (45)]] ...
