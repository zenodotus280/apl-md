### Problem
>The fundamental learning situation is one in which a person learns by helping someone who really knows what they are doing.

### Solution
>Arrange the work in every workgroup, industry, and office, in such a way that work and learning go forward hand in hand. Treat every piece of work as an opportunity for learning. To this end, organize work around a tradition of masters and apprentices: and support this form of social organization with a division of the workspace into spatial clusters—one for each master and their apprentices—where the group can work and meet together.

... the [[Network of Learning (18)]] in the community relies on the fact that learning is decentralized, and part and parcel of every activity - not just a classroom thing. In order to realize this pattern, it is essential that the individual workgroups, through- out industry, offices, workshops, and work communities, are all set up to make the learning process possible. This pattern, which shows the arrangement needed, therefore helps greatly to form [[Self-Governing Workshops and Offices (80)]] as well as the [[Network of Learning (18)]]. 

Arrange the workspaces as [[Half-Private Office (152)]] or [[Workspace Enclosure (183)]]. Keep workgroups small, and give every group a common area, a common meeting space, and a place where they can eat together - [[Common Areas at the Heart (129)]], [[Communal Eating (147)]], [[Small Work Groups (148)]], [[Small Meeting Rooms (151)]] ...
