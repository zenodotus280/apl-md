### Problem
>Every town has places in it which are so central and desirable that at least 30â€“50 households per acre will be living there. But the apartment houses which reach this density are almost all impersonal.

### Solution
>To build more than 30 dwellings per net acre, or to build housing three or four stories high, build a hill of houses. Build them to form stepped terraces, sloping toward the south, served by a great central open stair which also faces south and leads toward a common garden.

... at the still higher densities required in the inner ring of the community's [[Density Rings (29)]], and wherever densities rise above 30 houses per acre or are more than four stories high - [[Four-Story Limit (21)]], the house clusters become like hills.

Let people lay out their own houses individually, upon the terraces, just as if they were land - [[Your Own Home (79)]]. Since each terrace overlaps the one below it, each house has its garden on the house below [[Roof Garden (118)]]. Leave the the central stair open to the air, but give it a roof, in wet or snowy climates - perhaps a glass roof - [[Open Stairs (158)]]; and place the common land right at the bottom of the stair with playgrounds, flowers and vegetables for everyone - [[Common Land (67)]], [[Connected Play (68)]], [[Vegetable Garden (177)]] ...
