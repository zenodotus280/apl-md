In our own building system, we find it is worth putting on a light skim coat of plaster over the inner surfaces of the [[Wall Membranes (218)]] and [[Floor-Ceiling Vaults (219)]]. Wherever finish plaster meets columns, and beams, and doors and window frames, cover the joint with [[Half-Inch Trim (240)]] ...
