### Problem
>Around the age of 6 or 7, children develop a great need to learn by doing, to make their mark on a community outside the home. If the setting is right, these needs lead children directly to basic skills and habits of learning.

### Solution
>Instead of building large public schools for children 7 to 12, set up tiny independent schools, one school at a time. Keep the school small, so that its overheads are low and a teacher-student ratio of 1:10 can be maintained. Locate it in the public part of the community, with a shopfront and three or four rooms.

### Related Patterns
... the [[Children's Home (86)]] provides the beginning of learning and forms the foundation of the [[Network of Learning (18)]] in a community. As children grow older and more independent, these patterns must be supplemented by a mass of tiny institutions, schools.and yet not schools, dotted among the living functions of the community.

Place the school on a pedestrian street - [[Pedestrian Street (100)]]; near other functioning workshops - [[Self-Governing Workshops and Offices (80)]] and within walking distance of a park - [[Accessible Green (60)]]. Make it an identifiable part of the building it is part of - [[Building Complex (95)]]; and give it a good strong opening at the front, so that it is connected with the street-[[Opening to the Street (165)]] ...
