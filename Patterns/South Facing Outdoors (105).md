... within the general ideas of location which [[Site Repair (104)]] creates, this pattern governs the fundamental placing of the building and the open space around it with respect to sun.

When the building is more developed, you can concentrate on the special sunny areas where the outdoors and building meet, and make definite places there, where people can sit in the sun - [[Sunny Place (161)]] ...
