### Problem
> Dressing and undressing, storing clothes, having clothes lying around, have no reason to be part of any larger complex of activities. Indeed they disturb other activities: they are so self-contained that they themselves need concentrated space which has no other function.

### Solution
> Give everyone a dressing room-either private or shared - between their bed and the bathing room. Make this dressing room big enough so there is an open area in it at least six feet in diameter; about six linear feet of clothes hanging space; and another six feet of open shelves; two or three drawers; and a mirror.

### Related Patterns
... if the beds are in position - [[Marriage Bed (187)]], [[Bed Alcove (188)]] - we can give detailed attention to the dressing spaces - both to the closets where people keep their clothes and to the space they use for dressing. These dressing spaces may also help to form the [[Bathing Room (144)]].

Place each dressing room so that it gets plenty of natural [[Light on Two Sides of Every Room (159)]]. Use [[Thick Walls (197)]], [[Closets Between Rooms (198)]], and [[Open Shelves (200)]] to form its walls; include a wide shelf around the edge - [[Waist-High Shelf (201)]]; and for the detailed shape of the room, see [[The Shape of Indoor Space (191)]].
