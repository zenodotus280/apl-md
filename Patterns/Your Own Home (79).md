### Problem
>People cannot be genuinely comfortable and healthy in a house which is not theirs. All forms of rental—whether from private landlords or public housing agencies—work against the natural processes which allow people to form stable, self-healing communities.

### Solution
>Do everything possible to make the traditional forms of rental impossible, indeed, illegal. Give every household its own home, with space enough for a garden. Keep the emphasis in the definition of ownership on control, not on financial ownership. Indeed, where it is possible to construct forms of ownership which give people control over their houses and gardens, but make financial speculation impossible, choose these forms above all others. In all cases give people the legal power, and the physical opportunity to modify and repair their own places. Pay attention to this rule especially, in the case of high density apartments: build the apartments in such a way that every individual apartment has a garden, or a terrace where vegetables will grow, and that even in this situation, each family can build, and change, and add on to their house as they wish.

### Related Patterns
... according to [[The Family (75)]], each individual household should be a part of a larger family group household. Whether this is so, or not, each individual household, must also have a territory of its own which it controls completely - [[House for a Small Family (76)]], [[House for a Couple (77)]], [[House for One Person (78)]]; this pattern, which simply sets down the need for such a territory, helps especially to form higher density house clusters like [[Row Houses (38)]], [[Housing Hill (39)]], which often do not have well-defined individual territories for the separate households.

For the shape of the house, begin with [[Building Complex (95)]]. For the shape of the lot, do not accept the common notion of a lot which has a narrow frontage and a great deal of depth. Instead, try to make every house lot roughly square, or even long along the street and shallow. All this is necessary to create the right relation between house and garden - [[Half-Hidden Garden (111)]] ...
