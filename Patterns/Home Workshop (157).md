### Problem
>As the decentralization of work becomes more and more effective, the workshop in the home grows and grows in importance.

### Solution
>Make a place in the home where substantial work can be done; not just a hobby, but a job. Change the zoning laws to encourage modest, quiet work operations to locate in neighborhoods. Give the workshop perhaps a few hundred square feet; and locate it so it can be seen from the street and the owner can hang out a shingle.

... at the center of each [[House Cluster (37)]] and in [[Your Own Home (79)]] there needs to be one room or outbuilding, which is freely attached and accessible from the outside. This is the workshop. The following pattern tells us how important workshops are, how widely they ought to be scattered, how omnipresent, and when they are built, how easy to reach, and how public they should always be. It helps to reinforce the patterns of [[Scattered Work (9)]], [[Network of Learning (18)]], and [[Men and Women (27)]].

Give the workshop a corner where it is especially nice to work - [[Light on Two Sides of Every Room (159)]], [[Workspace Enclosure (183)]]; a strong connection to the street - [[Opening to the Street (165)]], [[Windows Overlooking Life (192)]]; perhaps a place to work in the sun on warm days - [[Sunny Place (161)]] For the shape of the workshop and its construction, start with [[The Shape of Indoor Space (191)]] ...
