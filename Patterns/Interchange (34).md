### Problem
>Interchanges play a central role in public transportation. Unless the interchanges are working properly, the public transportation system will not be able to sustain itself.

### Solution
>At every interchange in the web of transportation follow these principles:

>1. Surround the interchange with workplaces and housing types which specially need public transportation.
>2. Keep the interior of the interchange continuous with the exterior pedestrian network, and maintain this continuity by building in small shops and kiosks and by keeping parking to one side.
>3. Keep the transfer distance between different modes of transport down to 300 feet wherever possible, with an absolute maximum of 600 feet.

### Related Patterns
... this pattern defines the points which generate the [[Web of Public Transport (16)]]. It also helps to complete [[Local Transport Areas (11)]] by guaranteeing the possibility of interchanges at the center of each transport area, where people can change from their bikes, or local mini-buses, to the long distance transit lines that connect different transport areas to one another.

Recognize that the creation of workplaces around every interchange contributes to the development of [[Scattered Work (9)]]. Place [[Housing Hill (39)]], [[Old People Everywhere (40)]], and [[Work Community (41)]] round the interchange; treat the outside of the interchange as an [[Activity Nodes (30)]]; treat the transfers as [[Arcades (119)]] where necessary to keep them under cover; give every interchange a [[Bus Stop (92)]] on the [[Mini-Buses (20)]] network ...
