### Problem
>Traffic accidents are far more frequent where two roads cross than at T Junctions.

### Solution
>Lay out the road system so that any two roads which meet at grade, meet in three-way T junctions as near to 90 degrees as possible. Avoid four-way intersections and crossing movements.

### Related Patterns
... if major roads are in position -- [[Parallel Roads (23)]], and you are in the process of defining the local roads, this pattern gives the nature of the intersections. It will also greatly influence the layout of local roads, and will help to generate their loop-like character -- [[Looped Local Roads (49)]].

At busy junctions, where pedestrian paths converge, make a special raised crossing for pedestrians, something more than the usual crosswalk -- [[Road Crossing (54)]] ...
