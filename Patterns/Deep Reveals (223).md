### Problem
>Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they serve uncomfortable.

### Solution
>Make the window frame a deep, splayed edge: about a foot wide and splayed at about 50 to 60 degrees to the plane of the window, so that the gentle gradient of daylight gives a smooth transition between the light of the window and the dark of the inner wall.

### Related Patterns
... this pattern helps to complete the work of [[Light on Two Sides of Every Room (159)]], by going even further to reduce glare; and it helps to shape the [[Frames as Thickened Edges (225)]].

Build the depth of the frame so that it is continuous with the structure of the walls - [[Frames as Thickened Edges (225)]]; if the wall is thin, make up the necessary depth for the reveal on the inside face of the wall, with bookshelves, closets or other [[Thick Walls (197)]]; embellish the edge of the window even further, to make light even softer, with lace work, tracery, and climbing plants - [[Filtered Light (238)]], [[Half-Inch Trim (240)]], [[Climbing Plants (246)]] ...
