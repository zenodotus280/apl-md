### Problem
>Arcades—covered walkways at the edge of buildings, which are partly inside, partly outside—play a vital role in the way that people interact with buildings.

### Solution
>Wherever paths run along the edge of buildings, build arcades, and use the arcades, above all, to connect up the buildings to one another, so that a person can walk from place to place under the cover of the arcades.

### Related Patterns
... the [[Cascade of Roofs (116)]] may be completed by arcades. Paths along the building, short paths between buildings, [[Pedestrian Street (100)]], paths between [[Connected Buildings (108)]], and parts of [[Circulation Realms (98)]] are all best as arcades. This is one of the most beautiful patterns in the language; it affects the total character of buildings as few other patterns do.

Keep the arcade low - [[Ceiling Height Variety (190)]]; bring the roof of the arcade as low as possible - [[Sheltering Roof (117)]]; make the columns thick enough to lean against - [[Column Place (226)]]; and make the openings between columns narrow and low - [[Low Doorway (224)]], [[Column Connections (227)]] either by arching them or by making deep beams or with lattice work - so that the inside feels enclosed - [[Building Edge (160)]], [[Half-Open Wall (193)]]. For construction see [[Structure Follows Social Spaces (205)]] and [[Thickening the Outer Walls (211)]].
