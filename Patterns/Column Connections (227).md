### Problem
>The strength of a structure depends on the strength of its connections; and these connections are most critical of all at corners, especially at the corners where the columns meet the beams.

### Solution
>Build connections where the columns meet the beams. Any distribution of material which fills the corner up will do: fillets, gussets, column capitals, mushroom columns, and most general of all, the arch, which connects column and beam in a continuous curve.

### Related Patterns
... the columns are in position, and have been tied together by a perimeter beam - [[Box Columns (216)]], [[Perimeter Beams (217)]]. According to the principles of continuity which govern the basic structure - [[Efficient Structure (206)]], the connections need stiffening to lead the forces smoothly from the beams into the columns, especially when the columns are free standing as they are in an arcade or balcony - [[Arcades (119)]], [[Gallery Surround (166)]], [[Six-Foot Balcony (167)]], [[Column Place (226)]]. You may also do the same in the upper corners of your door and window frames - [[Frames as Thickened Edges (225)]] - making arched openings.

The connection is one of the most natural places for [[Ornament (249)]]: there is a wide variety of possible connections, carvings, fretwork, painting, for this critical position. In certain cases, the connection may act as an umbrella for a [[Column Place (226)]] ...
