### Problem
>Once a household for one person is part of some larger group, the most critical problem which arises is the need for simplicity.

### Solution
>Conceive a house for one person as a place of the utmost simplicity: essentially a one-room cottage or studio, with large and small alcoves around it. When it is most intense, the entire house may be no more than 300 to 400 square feet.

... the households with one person in them, more than any other, need to be a part of some kind of larger household - [[The Family (75)]]. Either build them to fit into some larger group household, or even attach them, as ancillary cottages to other, ordinary family households like [[House for a Small Family (76)]] or [[House for a Couple (77)]].

And again, make the house an individual piece of territory, with its own garden, no matter how small - [[Your Own Home (79)]]; make the main room essentially a kind of farmhouse kitchen - [[Farmhouse Kitchen (139)]], with alcoves opening off it for sitting, working, bathing, sleeping, dressing - [[Bathing Room (144)]], [[Window Place (180)]], [[Workspace Enclosure (183)]], [[Bed Alcove (188)]], [[Dressing Rooms (189)]]; if the house is meant for an old person, or for someone very young, shape it also according to the pattern for [[Old Age Cottage (155)]] or [[Teenager's Cottage (154)]] ...
