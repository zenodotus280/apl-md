### Problem
>Buildings must always be built on those parts of the land which are in the worst condition, not the best.

### Solution
>On no account place buildings in the places which are more beautiful. In fact, do the opposite. Consider the site and its buildings as a single living ecosystem. Leave those areas that are the most precious, beautiful, comfortable, and healthy as they are, and build new structures in those parts of the site which are least pleasant now.

### Related Patterns
... the most general aspects of a building complex are established in [[Building Complex (95)]], [[Number of Stories (96)]], and [[Circulation Realms (98)]]. The patterns which follow, and all remaining patterns in the language, concern the design of one single building and its surroundings. This pattern explains the very first action you must take - the process of repairing the site. Since it tends to identify very particular small areas of any site as promising areas of development, it is greatly supported by [[Building Complex (95)]] which breaks buildings into smaller parts, and therefore makes it possible to tuck them into different corners of the site in the best places.

Above all, leave trees intact and build around them with great care - [[Tree Places (171)]]; keep open spaces open to the south of buildings, for the sun -[[South Facing Outdoors (105)]]; try, generally, to shape space in such a way that each place becomes positive, in its own right - [[Positive Outdoor Space (106)]]. Repair slopes if they need it with [[Terraced Slope (169)]], and leave the outdoors in its natural state as much as possible - [[Garden Growing Wild (172)]]. If necessary, push and shove the building into odd corners to preserve the beauty of an old vine, a bush you love, a patch of lovely grass - [[Wings of Light (107)]], [[Long Thin House (109)]] ...
