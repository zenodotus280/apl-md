### Problem
>The suburb is an obsolete and contradictory form of human settlement.

### Solution
>In the zone where city and country meet, place country roads at least a mile apart, so that they enclose squares of countryside and farmland at least one square mile in area. Build homesteads along these roads, one lot deep, on lots of at least half an acre, with the square mile of open countryside or farmland behind the houses.

### Related Patterns
... according to the pattern [[City Country Fingers (3)]], there is a rather sharp division between city and rural land. But at the ends of city fingers, where the country fingers open out, there is a need for an additional kind of structure.

Make each square mile of countryside, both farm and park, open to the public -- [[The Countryside (7)]]; arrange the half acre lots to form clusters of houses and neighborhoods, even when they are rather spread out -- [[Identifiable Neighborhood (14)]], [[House Cluster (37)]].
