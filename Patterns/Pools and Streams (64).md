### Problem
>We came from the water; our bodies are largely water; and water plays a fundamental role in our psychology. We need constant access to water, all around us; and we cannot have it without reverence for water in all its forms. But everywhere in cities water is out of reach.

### Solution
>Preserve natural pools and streams and allow them to run through the city; make paths for people to walk along them and footbridges to cross them. Let the streams form natural barriers in the city, with traffic crossing them only infrequently on bridges.
>Whenever possible, collect rainwater in open gutters and allow it to flow above ground, along pedestrian paths and in front of houses. In places without natural running water, create fountains in the streets.

... the land, in its natural state, is hardly ever flat, and was, in its most primitive condition, overrun with rills and streams which carried off the rainwater. There is no reason to destroy this natural feature of the land in a town - [[Sacred Sites (24)]], [[Access to Water (25)]] - in fact, it is essential that it be preserved, or recreated. And in doing so it will be possible to deepen several larger patterns -boundaries between neighborhoods can easily be formed by streams - [[Neighborhood Boundary (15)]], quiet backs can be made more tranquil - [[Quiet Backs (59)]], pedestrian streets can be made more human and more natural - [[Pedestrian Street (100)]].

If at all possible, make all the pools and swimming holes part of the running water - not separate since this is the only way that pools are able to keep alive and clean without the paraphernalia of pumps and chlorine - [[Still Water (71)]]. Sometimes, here and there, give the place immediately around the water the atmosphere of contemplation; perhaps with arcades, perhaps some special common land, perhaps one end of a promenade - [[Promenade (31)]], [[Holy Ground (66)]], [[Arcades (119)]] ...
