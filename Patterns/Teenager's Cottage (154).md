### Problem
>If a teenager’s place in the home does not reflect their need for a measure of independence, they will be locked in conflict with their family.

### Solution
>To mark a child’s coming of age, transform their place in the home into a kind of cottage that expresses in a physical way the beginnings of independence. Keep the cottage attached to the home, but make it a distinctly visible bulge, far away from the master bedroom, with its own private entrance, perhaps its own roof.

...  in any house which has teenagers in it - [[The Family (75)]], [[House for a Small Family (76)]] - it is necessary to give special consideration to their rooms - [[A Room of One's Own (141)]]. If possible, these rooms should be attached but separate, and made to help create the possibility of later being [[Rooms to Rent (153)]].

Arrange the cottage to contain a [[Sitting Circle (185)]] and a [[Bed Alcove (188)]] but not a private bath and kitchen - sharing these is essential: it allows the boy or girl to keep enough connection with the family. Make it a place that can eventually become a guest room, room to rent, workshop, and so on - [[Rooms to Rent (153)]], [[Home Workshop (157)]]. If it is on an upper story, give it a separate private [[Open Stairs (158)]]. And for the shape of the cottage and its construction, start with [[The Shape of Indoor Space (191)]] and [[Structure Follows Social Spaces (205)]] ...
