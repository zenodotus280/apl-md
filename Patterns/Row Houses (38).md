### Problem
>At densities of 15 to 30 houses per acre, row houses are essential. But typical row houses are dark inside, and stamped from an identical mould.

### Solution
>For row houses, place houses along pedestrian paths that run at right angles to local roads and parking lots, and give each house a long frontage and a shallow depth.

### Related Patterns
... in certain parts of a community, the detached homes and gardens of a [[House Cluster (37)]] will not work, because they are not dense enough to generate the denser parts of [[Density Rings (29)]] and [[Degrees of Publicness (36)]]. To help create these larger patterns, it is necessary to build row houses instead.

Make the individual houses and cottages as long and thin as possible - [[Long Thin House (109)]]; vary the houses according to the different household types - [[The Family (75)]], [[House for a Small Family (76)]], [[House for a Couple (77)]], [[House for One Person (78)]]; build roads across the paths, at right angles to them - [[Parallel Roads (23)]], [[Network of Paths and Cars (52)]], with small parking lots off the roads - [[Small Parking Lots (103)]]. In other respects build row houses in clusters [[House Cluster (37)]], [[Building Complex (95)]] ...
