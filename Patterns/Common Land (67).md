### Problem
>Without common land no social system can survive.

### Solution
>Give over 25 percent of the land in house clusters to common land which touches, or is very very near, the homes which share it. Basic: be wary of the automobile; on no account let it dominate this land.

... just as there is a need for public land at the neighborhood level - [[Accessible Green (60)]], so also, within the clusters and work communities from which the neighborhoods are made, there is a need for smaller and more private kinds of common land shared by a few work groups or a few families. This common land, in fact, forms the very heart and soul of any cluster. Once it is defined, the individual buildings of the cluster form around it - [[House Cluster (37)]], [[Row Houses (38)]], [[Housing Hill (39)]], [[Work Community (41)]].

Shape the common land so it has some enclosure and good sunlight - [[South Facing Outdoors (105)]], [[Positive Outdoor Space (106)]]; and so that smaller and more private pieces of land and pockets always open onto it - [[Hierarchy of Open Space (114)]]; provide communal functions within the land - [[Public Outdoor Room (69)]], [[Local Sports (72)]], [[Vegetable Garden (177)]]; and connect the different and adjacent pieces of common land to one another to form swaths of connected play space - [[Connected Play (68)]]. Roads can be part of common land if they are treated as [[Green Streets (51)]] ...
