### Problem
>The archetypal zen view occurs in a famous Japanese house, which gives this pattern its name.

### Solution
>If there is a beautiful view, don’t spoil it by building huge windows that gape incessantly at it. Instead, put the windows which look onto the view at places of transition — along paths, in hallways, in entry ways, on stairs, between rooms.
>If the view window is correctly placed, people will see a glimpse of the distant view as they come up to the window or pass it: but the view is never visible from the places where people stay.

It helps to place and detail [[Entrance Transition (112)]], [[Entrance Room (130)]], [[Short Passages (132)]], [[Staircase as a Stage (133)]] - and outside, [[Paths and Goals (120)]].

If the view must be visible from inside a room, make a special corner of the room which looks onto the view, so that the enjoyment of the view becomes a definite act in its own right ...
