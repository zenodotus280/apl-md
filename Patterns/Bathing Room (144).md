### Problem

    “The motions we call bathing are mere ablutions which formerly preceded the bath. The place where they are performed, though adequate for the routine, does not deserve to be called a bathroom.”

    — Bernard Rudofsky

### Solution
>Concentrate the bathing room, toilets, showers, and basins of the house in a single tiled area. Locate this bathing room beside the couple’s realm—with private access—in a position halfway between the private secluded parts of the house and the common areas; if possible, give it access to the outdoors; perhaps a tiny balcony or walled garden.
>Put in a large bath—large enough for at least two people to get completely immersed in water; an efficiency shower and basins for the actual business of cleaning; and two or three racks for huge towels—one by the door, one by the shower, one by the sink.

### Related Patterns
... this pattern defines and places the main bathroom of a building. It does it by changing the present character of bathing rooms completely: And its position is so clear, and so essential, that it will probably help to form the sleeping areas and public areas given by larger patterns: [[Intimacy Gradient (127)]], [[Common Areas at the Heart (129)]], [[Couple's Realm (136)]], [[Children's Realm (137)]], [[Sleeping to the East (138)]], [[Bed Cluster (143)]].

Above all, make sure that there is light, plenty of light - [[Light on Two Sides of Every Room (159)]] and [[Filtered Light (238)]]; try to place the bathing room so that it opens out into a private part of the garden - [[Garden Wall (173)]], and perhaps even gives direct access to some local swimming pool - [[Still Water (71)]]. Line up the toilet with the compost chamber - [[Compost (178)]]; and for the detailed shape of the room and its construction, start with [[The Shape of Indoor Space (191)]] ...
