### Problem
>Nobody wants fast through-traffic going by their homes.

### Solution
>Lay out local roads so that they form loops. A loop is defined as any stretch of road which makes it impossible for cars that don’t have destinations on it to use as a shortcut. Do not allow any one loop to serve more than 50 cars, and keep the road really narrow—17 to 20 feet is quite enough.

... assume that neighborhoods, house clusters, work communities, and major roads are more or less defined -- [[Local Transport Areas (11)]], [[Identifiable Neighborhood (14)]], [[Parallel Roads (23)]], [[House Cluster (37)]], [[Work Community (41)]]. Now, for, the layout of the local roads.

Make all the junctions between the local roads three-way T junctions, never four-way intersections -- [[T Junctions (50)]]; wherever there is any possibility of life from buildings be oriented towards the road, give the road a very rough surface of grass and gravel, with paving stones for wheels of cars -- [[Green Streets (51)]]; keep parking off the road in driveways -- [[Small Parking Lots (103)]] and [[Car Connection (113)]]; except where the roads are very quiet, run pedestrian paths at right angles to them, not along them, and make buildings open off these paths, not off the roads -- [[Network of Paths and Cars (52)]] ...
