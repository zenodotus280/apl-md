### Problem
>The perfectly crystalline squares and rectangles of ultra-modern architecture make no special sense in human or in structural terms. They only express the rigid desires and fantasies which people have when they get too preoccupied with systems and the means of their production.

### Solution
>With occasional exceptions, make each indoor space or each position of a space, a rough rectangle, with roughly straight walls, near right angles in the corners, and a roughly symmetrical vault over each room.

### Related Patterns
... from [[Ceiling Height Variety (190)]] you have an overall conception of each floor in the building as a cascade of heights, typically highest in the middle where the largest rooms are, lower toward the edge where the small rooms are, and varying with floor also, so that the lower floors will tend to have a higher average ceiling height than upper floors. This pattern takes each individual space, within this overall cascade, and gives it a more definite shape.

You can define the room with columns, one at each corner - [[Columns at the Corners (212)]]; and the shape of the ceiling can be given exactly by the ceiling vault - [[Floor and Ceiling Layout (210)]], [[Floor-Ceiling Vaults (219)]]. Avoid curved walls except where they are strictly necessary - [[Wall Membranes (218)]]. Where occasional curved walls like bay windows do jut out into the outside, place them to help create [[Positive Outdoor Space (106)]]. Make the walls of each room generous and deep - [[Thick Walls (197)]], [[Closets Between Rooms (198)]]; and where it is appropriate, make them [[Half-Open Wall (193)]]. For the patterns on the load-bearing structure, engineering, and construction, begin with [[Structure Follows Social Spaces (205)]]
