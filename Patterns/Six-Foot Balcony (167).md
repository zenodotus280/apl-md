>Whenever you build a balcony, a porch, a gallery, or a terrace always make it at least six feet deep. If possible, recess at least a part of it into the building so that it is not cantilevered out and separated from the building by a simple line, and enclose it partially.

Keep it open toward the south - [[Sunny Place (161)]]. Treat it as an [[Outdoor Room (163)]], and get the details of its shape and its construction from [[The Shape of Indoor Space (191)]] ...
