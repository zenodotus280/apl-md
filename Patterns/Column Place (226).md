### Problem
>Thin columns, spindly columns, columns which take their shape from structural arguments alone, will never make a comfortable environment.

### Solution
>When a column is free standing, make it as thick as a person—at least 12 inches, preferably 16 inches: and form places around it where people can sit and lean comfortably: a step, a small seat built up against the column, or a space formed by a pair of columns.

### Related Patterns
... certain columns, especially those which are free standing, play an important social role, beyond their structural role as [[Columns at the Corners (212)]]. These are, especially, the columns which help to form arcades, galleries, porches, walkways, and outdoor rooms - [[Public Outdoor Room (69)]], [[Arcades (119)]], [[Outdoor Room (163)]], [[Gallery Surround (166)]], [[Six-Foot Balcony (167)]], [[Trellised Walk (174)]]. This pattern defines the character these columns need to make them function socially.

You can get the extra thickness quite cheaply if you build the column as a [[Box Columns (216)]]; complete the "place" the column forms, by giving it a "roof" in the form of a column capital, or vault which springs from the column, or by bracing the column against the beams - [[Column Connections (227)]]. And when it makes sense, make the column base a [[Sitting Wall (243)]], a place for flowers - [[Raised Flowers (245)]], or a place for a chair or table - [[Different Chairs (251)]] ...
