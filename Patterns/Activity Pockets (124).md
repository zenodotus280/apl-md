### Problem
>The life of a public square forms naturally around its edge. If the edge fails, then the space never becomes lively.

### Solution
>Surround public gathering places with pockets of activityâ€”small, partly enclosed areas at the edges, which jut forward into the open space between the paths, and contain activities which make it natural for people to pause and get involved.

### Related Patterns
... in many large scale patterns which define public space, the edge is critical: [[Promenade (31)]], [[Small Public Squares (61)]], [[Public Outdoor Room (69)]], [[Pedestrian Street (100)]], [[Building Thoroughfare (101)]], [[Path Shape (121)]]. This pattern helps complete the edge of all these larger patterns.

Lead paths between the pockets of activity - [[Paths and Goals (120)]] - and shape the pockets themselves with arcades and seats, and sitting walls, and columns and trellises - [[Arcades (119)]], [[Outdoor Room (163)]], [[Trellised Walk (174)]], [[Seat Spots (241)]], [[Sitting Wall (243)]]; above all shape them with the fronts of buildings - [[Building Fronts (122)]]; and include, within the pockets, newsstands - [[Bus Stop (92)]], [[Food Stands (93)]], gardens, games, small shops, [[Street Cafe (88)]], and [[A Place to Wait (150)]] ...
