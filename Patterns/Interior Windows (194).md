>Windows are most often used to create connections between the indoor and the outdoors. But there are many cases when an indoor space needs a connecting window another indoor space.

### Solution
>Put in fully glazed fixed windows between rooms which tend to be dead because they have too little action in them or where inside rooms are unusually dark.

... at various places in the building, there are walls between rooms where windows would help the rooms to be more alive by creating more views of people and by letting extra light into the darkest corners.

Make the windows the same as any other windows, with small panes of glass - [[Small Panes (239)]]. In some case it may be right to build interior windows in the doors - [[Solid Doors with Glass (237)]] ...
