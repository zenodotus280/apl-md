>Windows are most often used to create connections between the indoor and the outdoors. But there are many cases when an indoor space needs a connecting window another indoor space.

>Put in fully glazed fixed windows between rooms which tend to be dead because they have too little action in them or where inside rooms are unusually dark.

Make the windows the same as any other windows, with small panes of glass - [[Small Panes (239)]]. In some case it may be right to build interior windows in the doors - [[Solid Doors with Glass (237)]] ...
