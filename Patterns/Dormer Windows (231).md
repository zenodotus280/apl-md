>Wherever you have windows in the roof, make dormer windows which are high enough to stand in, and frame them like any other alcoves in the building.

### Related Patterns
... this pattern helps to complete [[Sheltering Roof (117)]]. If you have followed sheltering roof, your roof has living space within it: and it must therefore have windows in it, to bring light into the roof. This pattern is a special kind of [[Window Place (180)]], which completes the [[Roof Vaults (220)]], in these situations.

Frame them like [[Alcoves (179)]] and [[Window Place (180)]] with [[Gradual Stiffening (208)]], [[Columns at the Corners (212)]], [[Box Columns (216)]], [[Perimeter Beams (217)]], [[Wall Membranes (218)]], [[Floor-Ceiling Vaults (219)]], [[Roof Vaults (220)]] and [[Frames as Thickened Edges (225)]].
Put [[Windows Which Open Wide (236)]] in them, and make [[Small Panes (239)]] ...
