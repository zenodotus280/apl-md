### Problem
>It is not possible to avoid the need for high-speed roads in modern society; but it is essential to place them and build them in such a way that they do not destroy communities or countryside.

### Solution
>Place high-speed roads (freeways and other major arteries) so that:
>1. At least one high-speed road lies tangent to each local transport area.
>2. Each local transport area has a least one side not bounded by a high-speed road, but directly open to the countryside.
>3. The road is always sunken, or shielded along its length by berms, or earth, or industrial buildings, to protect the nearby neighborhoods from noise.

### Related Patterns
... the ring roads which this pattern specifies, help to define and generate the [[Local Transport Areas (11)]]; if they are placed to make connections between [[Interchange (34)]]; they also help to form the [[Web of Public Transport (16)]].

Always place the high speed roads on boundaries between subcultures -- [[Subculture Boundary (13)]] and never along the waterfronts -- [[Access to Water (25)]]. Place industry and big parking garages next to the roads, and use them, whenever possible, as extra noise shields -- [[Industrial Ribbon (42)]], [[Shielded Parking (97)]] ...
