### Problem
>Have you ever walked into a public building and been processed by the receptionist as if you were a package?

### Solution
>Arrange a series of welcoming things immediately inside the entrance—soft chairs, a fireplace, food, coffee. Place the reception desk so that it is not between the receptionist and the welcoming area, but to one side at an angle—so that she, or he, can get up and walk toward the people who come in, greet them, and then invite them to sit down.

Make sure that the reception point itself is lighter than surrounding areas - [[Tapestry of Light and Dark (135)]]. And for the shape of the reception space start with [[The Shape of Indoor Space (191)]] ...
