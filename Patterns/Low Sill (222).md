### Problem
>One of a windowâ€™s most important functions is to put you in touch with the outdoors. If the sill is too high, it cuts you off.

### Solution
>When determining exact location of windows also decide which windows should have low sills. On the first floor, make the sills of windows which you plan to sit by between 12 and 14 inches high. On the upper stories, make them higher, around 20 inches.

Make the window open outward, so that you can use the sill as a shelf, and so that you can lean out and tend the flowers. If you can, put flowers right outside the window, on the ground or raised a little, too, so that you can always see the flowers from inside the room - [[Raised Flowers (245)]] ...
